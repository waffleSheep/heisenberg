Formulated by German Scientist Werner Heisenberg, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that there is a degree of uncertainty intrisic to both the position and momentum of particle such that both cannot be known with perfect accuracy.

To the classical physicist, the very notion and existence of the uncertainty principle is bizarre. How can the position and momentum of a given item not be precisely known simultaneously. In this website, we will explain the reasoning behind and applications of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
