## The Uncertainty Principle

Formulated by German Scientist Werner Heisenberg, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that there is a degree of uncertainty intrisic to both the position and momentum of particle such that both cannot be known with perfect accuracy.

To the classical physicist, the very notion and existence of the uncertainty principle is bizarre. How can the position and momentum of a given item not be precisely known simultaneously. In this website, we will explain the reasoning behind and applications of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

## Information
This site was created by Karimi Zayan, Lim Lynus and Vernon Jude Pui Zhi Xian from M22505 for the PC5132 Advanced Physics IV module.

The site is about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and its applications. The site is intended for students of ages 18-21 with basic knowledge of calculus, classical physics and statistics and are keen to learn more.

### Video
As an accompaniment to this website, we have also prepared an original video to explain this topic.
