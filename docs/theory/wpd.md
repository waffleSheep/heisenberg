## The wave theory and blackbody radiation

Prior to the 20th century there were numerous theories about the nature of light. One such prominent theory was the wave theory of light. In 1801, this theory was strengthened by the double-slit experiment which showed that light interferes like a wave. Soon, the wave theory became the dominant theory on the nature of light as it could also explain phenomena such as the polarisation of light.

However, following the turn of the century, Max Planck found a solution to a pre-existing problem with weird assumptions (at the time). Planck was working on a theoretical model for the wavelengths of light emitted by a blackbody (A theoretical perfect absorber of energy) at given temperatures. Previous attempts used known theories of light and energy and failed to describe the phenomena for higher frequencies this was known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe".

However, Planck was successful because he made rather strange assumptions. One of the key assumptions was that the energy emitted or absorbed by a blackbody was quantised, or in discrete packets as opposed to continuously being emitted or absorbed and that the energy of each packet was described as such

$$E=hf$$

where $h = 6.626 \times {10}^{-34} Js$ (known as planck's constant) and $f$ is frequency. With this, and some other key assumptions Planck was able to determine the formula to explain blackbody radiation.

Planck made the assertion that only the energy of radiating atoms was quantised and not that light itself was quantised and the wave theory held strong.

## The electron and the photoelectric effect

Around the same time, JJ thompson discovered the first subatomic particle known as the electron through the cathode ray experiment. The electron had a negative charge and it was speculated that atoms consisted of a positively charged cloud with tiny electrons. This was known as the plum-pudding model.

Delocalised mobile electrons in certain elements and compounds (such as metals and alloys) can flow to create a current when there is a voltage difference between 2 points.
