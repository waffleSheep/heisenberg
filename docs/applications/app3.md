# Determining the size of the hydrogen atom in ground state



The total energy of the system is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E = (kinetic proton of proton) + (kinetic energy of proton) + (potential energy of interaction between protons and electrons)\\
= 0 + \frac{{p}^{2}}{2m} +\frac{(|e|)(-|e|)}{(4\pi{\epsilon}_{0}r)}
\end{aligned}
$$
where m = eletron mass, and ${\epsilon}_{0} = \frac{{10}^{-9}}{36\pi} farad/m = permittivity of free space.$
$$
\begin{aligned}
E =  0 + \frac{{p}^{2}}{2m} -\frac{(|e|)(|e|)}{(4\pi{\epsilon}_{0}r)}

\end{aligned}
$$ 
The eletron can be anywhere in the radius, r, of the atom at ground state. hence the maximum uncertainty of the position of the electron in one dimension is r. 
From the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{x}_{x}\sigma_{p}_{x}&= \frac{h}{4\pi}\\
Solving for the minimum uncertainty in momemtum
p\texttildelow (\sigma_{{p}_{min}})\texttildelow\frac{h}{4\sigma_{p}_{xmax}\pi} =\frac{h}{4x\pi} 

\end{aligned}

$$
