## Quantum Tunneling
Due to the Heisenberg uncertaintaty principle, we are unable to fully know the exact location of a particle, and this uncertainty allows a particle to pass through an otherwise insurmountable potential barrier. 
The heisenberg principle is below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_x\sigma_p&= \frac{h}{4\pi}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

A particle can be visualised as both a wave and a particle. This can be seen as an intepretation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle, as the position and the momentum of the particle can never be precisely known, hence the probability of a given particles existence on the other side of an opposing barrier is non-zero, and so there is a small probability of particles being found there, somehow overcoming the barrier without the requisite energy to do so.
To cross the otherwise insurmountable potential barrier, the particles "borrow" enregy from the surroundings and to follow the law of conservation of energy, they return the extra energy in the form more energetic reflected waves/particles. 

(insert figure here somewhere)


Consider particles moving towards a barrier. They act like a wave. This barrier compresses the wave, causing it to become taller and narrower,
## Scanning Electron Microscope
In classical mechanics, a impenetratable barrier cannot be passed through if a particle collides with it. However, in quantum mechanics, due to quantum tunneling, electrons can pass thorugh the impenetratable barrier (para phase below)When the tip is brought very near to the surface to be examined, a bias voltage applied between the two allows electrons to tunnel through the vacuum separating them. The resulting tunneling current is a function of the tip position, applied voltage, and the local density of states (LDOS) of the sample. Information is acquired by monitoring the current as the tip scans across the surface, and is usually displayed in image form
