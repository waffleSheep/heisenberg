# Non-existence of electrons in the nucleus

The radius of the necleus is approximately ${10}^{14}m$. We shall start by assuming that electrons exist in the nucleus. Hence the uncertainty in the position of the electron is given by:

$$\sigma_x= {10}^{-14}m$$


According to the Uncertainty principle,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_x\sigma_p&= \frac{h}{4\pi}\\
\sigma_p&= \frac{h}{4\pi\sigma_x}\\
\sigma_p&= \frac{6.62\times{10}^{-34}}{(4\times3.14\times{10}^{-14})}\\
\sigma_p&=5.27 \times {10}^{-21} kg ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the uncertainty in momentum $\sigma_p=5.27 \times {10}^{-21} kg ms^{-1} $ , then the momentum of the electron should be at least that much.

As the momentum of this electron is at least this high, the velocity also approches relativistic speeds. Hence we have to use the equation below to calculate the energy of the electron.




$$
\begin{aligned}
E&=  \sqrt{ {m}^{2}{c}^{4} + {p}^{2}{c}^{2}}\\
E &= \sqrt{{({9.1}\times{10}^{-31})}^{2}\times{({3}\times{10}^{8})}^{4}+{{5.27}\times{10}^{-21}}^{2}\times{({3}\times{10}^{8})}^{2}}\\
&= 1.58\times{10}^{-12}J\\
&= 9.89MeV
\end{aligned}

If the electron exists in the nucleus, it has to have at least $9.89 MeV$ of energy. However, electrons, or beta-particles, ejected from the nucleus has energies of approximately $3 MeV$, and experimental results show no electron or particle in an atom possess energy greater than $4MeV$. Hence, an electron that could exist in the nucleaus does not exist as no such electron with that much energy when emitted has been found.
