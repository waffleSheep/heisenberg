To cross the otherwise insurmountable potential barrier, the particles \"borrow\" energy from the surroundings and to follow the law of conservation of energy, they return the extra energy in the form of more energetic reflected waves/particles. Consider particles moving towards a barrier. They act like a wave. This barrier compresses the wave, causing it to become taller and narrower, but some of the waves still manage to pass through the barrier, allowing for the probability of the particles to be found on the other side of the barrier to be low but non-zero, hence particles will be found on the other side of the barrier. Scanning Electron Microscope A scanning electron microscope generally consists of a scanning tip, a piezoelectrically controlled height and lateral scanner, and a coarse approach mechanism to bring the tip to the sample. These components are controlled by a computer and supported by techniques which can prevent the vibrations from reaching the microscope. these items are often put in an airtight cylinder, and air will be removed to form a vacuum when in use. During use, the coarse approach mechanism is used to bring the tip close to the sample. Afterwards, the piezoelectrically controlled scanner extends the tip, and a bias voltage is applied between the sample and the tip until a current is formed between the sample and the tip through quantum tunnelling. This typically occurs in the 0-4-0.7nm range, so the tip is kept at that distance from the sample. As the tip is moved across the surface, the current formed from tunnelling changes based on the height of the sample at that point, allowing the computer connected to the Scanning Tunneling Microscope to determine the shape and contour of the sample. Afterwards, the data will be generated in image form on the connected computer.","title":"Quantum Tunneling and Scanning Electron Microscope"},{"location":"applications/tunneling/#quantum-tunneling-and-scanning-electron-microscope","text":"","title":"Quantum Tunneling and Scanning Electron Microscope"},{"location":"applications/tunneling/#quantum-tunneling","text":"Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we are unable to fully know the exact location of a particle, and this uncertainty allows a particle to pass through an otherwise insurmountable potential barrier.

Classical physics on the other hand studies matter and energy on a macroscopic scale - that is, on a scale that we are more used to seeing in daily life. Image courtesy of http://clearlyexplained.com/quantum-mechanics/index.html Though the mathematical basis of quantum mechanics is well-agreed upon (and verified through experiments), there exist many different ways to explain how these mathematical theories correspond to our experienced reality. These are known as interpretations of quantum mechanics, and there is no consensus on which one \"best\" represents our reality. For this series of writeups, we will be explaining using the Copenhagen Interpretation. It is important to note, however, that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle still holds no matter which other interpretation is chosen. Brief Introduction to the Copenhagen Interpretation In day-to-day life, we are used to describing a position with a definite value. If you see a football on the ground, you know the football is there. We say that the position of the football is at that point - exactly where we see it. And no matter how we kick the ball around, we know it will always have a position - it will always be somewhere we can describe with a real \"location\". The same doesn't apply to quantum mechanics. Under the Copenhagen interpretation, observable quantities like position have no reality until they are measured. A state describes the conditions of a system. In each of these states, an observable quantity (e.g. position) can take on different values - imagine our ball being in various locations on a field. Until a measurement is performed, the system exists as a superposition of these quantum states. This means the ball seems to be in multiple places at the same time, which is very unintuitive and suggests we need a different way to think about it. Since the ball doesn't always have a definite position where it can be found, we can only describe its location in terms of the probability of finding it in different locations. In other words, quantum theory can only provide us with a probability distribution for a measurement's outcome. Of course, if you can SEE the ball, you know where it is. We know intuitively that the act of measurement must only give us one definite, actual value. How then does quantum mechanics explain this? This is known as the measurement problem, and the Copenhagen interpretation explains it as follows: When we measure an observable quantity, we are forcing the system into a state where the observable has a single, definite value. This is known as an eigenstate of that observable. Animation courtesy of https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-a-particle-20201112/ As a (poorly contrived, but 100% original) analogy, think of a spinning coin. Is the coin showing heads or tails? While the coin is still spinning, this question has no meaning - if anything, it's showing neither. But imagine now we slap the coin with our palm, flat onto the table. When we lift our hand, we will see the coin necessarily shows either heads or tails. The act of measurement has forced it into an eigenstate, in which the observable value is either 'heads' or 'tails'. This is analogous to the wave-function collapse in the Copenhagen interpretation. When we measure a quantity, we suddenly force the system into any of the states that do have a definite value for that quantity. But while we aren't measuring it, the system can continue to exist as a superposition of these states, and the quantity returns to having no definite value. Heisenberg's Microscope Heisenberg's microscope describes the thought experiment that Heisenberg formulated as an introduction to his uncertainty principle. Suppose we wish to determine the position and momentum of an electron, which we will (ironically) treat as a classical particle. Let the wavelength of the light rays be \\(\\lambda\\) . Let the cone of light rays focusing on the electron make an angle \\(2\\theta\\) with the electron. According to the Rayleigh criterion, we can only resolve the position of the electron to the following accuracy. Our uncertainty in lateral position \\(\\Delta{x}\\) is related to the wavelength of light and angle \\(\\theta\\) as follows: $$ \\Delta{x}=\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin{\\theta}} $$ We also know that when a photon strikes an electron, the electron experiences Compton recoil with momentum proportional to \\(\\frac{h}{\\lambda}\\) . But since the direction of the scattered photon can be anywhere within the cone of light rays, we cannot determine the angle from which the photon collided with the electron! This is illustrated below: As such, we can only determine the electron's momentum in the x direction with the following accuracy: $$ \\Delta{p}_{x} \\approx \\frac{h}{\\lambda}2\\sin{\\theta} $$ Suppose we want to decrease the uncertainty of the position, i.e. decrease \\(\\Delta{x}\\) . If we decrease the wavelength of light, we can resolve the position with greater accuracy. But the photon will strike the electron with more momentum and result in even greater uncertainty in the electron's final momentum. On the other hand, if we increase \\(\\theta\\) by widening the microscope's aperture, we can also resolve the position to a greater accuracy (as shown by the Rayleigh criterion). But since the angle the cone of light makes with the electron is larger, the scattered photon could be moving in a wider range of directions. This also increases the uncertainty in the electron's final momentum in the x-direction. Looking at the equations together, we begin to get a picture of why we cannot perfectly determine both the momentum and the position of an electron. Any action taken to decrease the uncertainty of either momentum or position will increase the uncertainty in the other variable. In 1927, Heisenberg used these results to formulate an approximate expression of the uncertainty principle, $$ \\Delta{x}\\Delta{p_x} \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin{\\theta}} \\left(\\frac{h}{\\lambda}2\\sin{\\theta}\\right) = h $$ It would only be later in that year when Earle Hesse Kennard would first prove the inequality we associate with the uncertainty principle today: \\[ \\sigma_x\\sigma_p\\geq\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\] Confusion with the Observer Effect Heisenberg's original thought experiment made use of the observer effect (also known as the observer's paradox), in which the act of measurement causes the system to change. Unfortunately, this has led to people incorrectly attributing the uncertainty principle TO the observer effect. The observer effect is undeniably at play in the act of measurement, but its involvement is limited to the collapse of the wave function (at least, under the Copenhagen interpretation). The uncertainty in our measurements is not a result of the act of measurement introducing error to the system - rather, the uncertainty is intrinsic to all quantum systems. Even if we were to devise a measurement method that did not disturb the system by changing its momentum or position, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle would still hold because of the statistical uncertainty of those variables. So what does uncertainty mean? Momentum and position are incompatible observables and are special in that they are canonical conjugate quantities. That is, one is the Fourier transform of the other. Such pairs of variables do not commute, which implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be a position eigenstate and a momentum eigenstate . In other words, there exists no such preparation of a system such that only one possible value of BOTH position and momentum can be associated with it. If we measure the momentum and force the system into a momentum eigenstate, the state cannot be a position eigenstate - i.e. the value of momentum corresponds to multiple possible states, each with different values of position. There is a limit to how much we can know simultaneously about position and momentum, and this limit is quantified in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Wave Mechanics According to the De Broglie hypothesis, all matter has a wave-like nature. In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction gives us the probability amplitudes for observables such as position. Consider the below animation, which shows a wave packet in position space moving from left to right. Animation courtesy of WikiMedia At each point for a certain instant in time, the amplitude of the wave in position space gives us the probability of finding the particle at that position. Wave packets such as these are caused by the constructive interference of several component waves over a small region of space, and destructive interference everywhere else. The principle of quantum superposition states that the quantum state can be represented as a sum of multiple other distinct states. We can hence think of the above wave packet as consisting of several constituent waves, each of which is associated with a different wavelength. Since they are each associated with only one wavelength (and thus by \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\) , also associated with only one value of momentum), these component waves are eigenvectors of momentum. When we add more component waves of varying wavelengths, the wave packet above will be more localized and \"narrower\". This can be interpreted as reducing the spread of probabilities of values for our position and hence reducing its uncertainty. But with our quantum state now consisting of more varying wavelengths, the uncertainty in the wavelength (and thus momentum) must increase. When we take a measurement, the wave function could be forced to collapse into any one of these constituent eigenvectors, and hence could give us varying values for momentum. We have decreased the uncertainty in position but increased the uncertainty in momentum. On the other hand, imagine if our quantum state consisted of only one fixed-wavelength wave. Any measurement must give us the same value of momentum, but the probability distribution for its position would be spread out throughout all of the space (consider a regular sine wave). There is now no uncertainty in momentum, but an enormous uncertainty in the position. This property is not unique to position and momentum. Any two variables that are Fourier transforms of each other (i.e. conjugate variables) will also suffer a similar trade-off. The more concentrated a certain function is, the more spread out its Fourier transform will be.","title":"Quantum Mechanics"},{"location":"theory/qm/#quantum-mechanics","text":"","title":"Quantum Mechanics"},{"location":"theory/qm/#background-to-quantum-mechanics","text":"Quantum mechanics is the study of the physical properties of matter, on the scale of atomic or subatomic particles.

One such prominent theory was the wave theory of light. In 1801, this theory was strengthened by the double-slit experiment which showed that light interferes like a wave. Soon, the wave theory became the dominant theory on the nature of light as it could also explain phenomena such as the polarization of light. However, following the turn of the century, Max Planck found a solution to a pre-existing problem with weird assumptions (at the time). Planck was working on a theoretical model for the wavelengths of light emitted by a blackbody (A theoretical perfect absorber of energy) at given temperatures. Previous attempts used known theories of light and energy and failed to describe the phenomena for higher frequencies this was known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\". However, Planck was successful because he made rather strange assumptions. One of the key assumptions was that the energy emitted or absorbed by a blackbody was quantised, or in discrete packets as opposed to continuously being emitted or absorbed and that the energy of each packet was described as such \\[E=hf\\] where \\(h = 6.626 \\times {10}^{-34} Js\\) (known as Planck's constant) and \\(f\\) is frequency. With this and some other key assumptions Planck was able to determine the formula to explain blackbody radiation. \\[B_{f}(T)={\\frac {2f ^{2}}{c^{2}}}{\\frac {hf }{e^{hf /kT}-1}}\\] Planck asserted that only the energy of radiating atoms was quantised and not that light itself was quantised and the wave theory while slightly shaken, held strong. The electron and the photoelectric effect Around the same time, JJ Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle known as the electron through the cathode ray experiment. The electron had a negative charge and it was speculated that atoms consisted of a positively charged volume with electrons. This was known as the plum-pudding model. Delocalised mobile electrons in certain elements and compounds (such as metals and alloys) can move to create a current when there is a voltage difference between regions. \\[I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}\\] A few years before the discovery of the electron, Heinrich Hertz observed the photoelectric effect. He saw that when you place 2 metal spheres very close to each and shone light, sparks would be observed between the 2 spheres. Thompson showed that these sparks were electrons. To explain this classical physicists suggested that the oscillating electric field of the light wave was heating electrons and causing them to vibrate, eventually providing them with enough energy for it to overcome the attraction to the positively charged cloud of the atom. They came to this assumption with the wave theory of light and predicted that the KE of emitted electrons should be proportional to the amplitude of the light wave and that the rate of electron emission (or current) should be proportional to the frequency. However, both these assumptions were proven to be wrong. It was found experimentally that KE increases with frequency and current increases with amplitude. It was also found that for light with low frequency, the effect was not observed regardless of intensity. This was a big shock and brought into question the wave theory of light. However, Albert Einstein came to the rescue and explained this phenomenon while building on Planck's work. He first realised that unlike what Planck asserted, light itself was quantised and was behaving like it was composed of tiny particles (now known as photons) where each particle had energy proportional to its frequency. \\[{E}_{photon}=hf\\] This explained the fact as to why the kinetic energy increased with frequency because since energy could only be transmitted discretely as compared to a continuous wave, only photons with high enough energy were able to free the electrons from the surface when hit regardless of the amplitude of the wave. It also explained why the current increased with amplitude because an increase in amplitude caused an increase in the number of photons hitting the metal surface Of course, Einstein realised that light could not be just a particle because particles collide and light interferes so he postulated that light consisted of spatially localized, discrete wave packets. These wave packets have properties of both wave and particles because they interfere like waves but are still localised like particles. Einstein also defined the momentum of a photon as such \\[p_{photon}=\\frac{E_{photon}}{c}\\] Compton Scattering After Einstein's conclusions, another experiment known as the Compton scattering experiment was carried out by Arthur Holly Compton. He found that when you beamed X-rays at a graphene target and made it reflect through a slit at an angle \\(\\theta\\) such that it hits a rotating crystal an interesting result would be observed. It was expected that the wavelength of the light would stay the same after being measured. However, he found that the light would be scattered and the measured wavelengths peaked at either the original wavelength or a new wavelength higher than that of the original. Compton explained his findings by hypothesising that the scattering was observed because the individual photons of the x-ray were hitting the electrons of the crystal target. This explains the increase in wavelength as some of the energy of the photon would be transferred to the electron causing its frequency to decrease and its wavelength to increase. The electron also experienced an increase in momentum proportional to \\(\\frac{h}{\\lambda}\\) further strengthening his hypothesis. Using this, he developed a theoretical model for his empirical data. \\[\\lambda '-\\lambda ={\\frac {h}{m_{e}c}}(1-\\cos {\\theta }) \\] He found that his model fit the data and he showed that electron's have particle-like properties in that they can collide like particles and the momentum was conserved in photon-electron collisions. de Broglie's hypothesis In 1924, French Physicist Louis De Broglie came up with the idea that all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties and that the wavelength of a particle is related to its momentum in the following way \\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\] This equation is the same as einstein's equation but applied to matter. In 1927, his theory was further confirmed by 2 different experiments. Electron Diffraction Diffraction is the spreading out of waves through an aperture or around objects. It occurs when the size of the aperture or object is the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of the wave. Visible light has wavelengths of magnitude \\(100 \\, nm\\) . Hence, the slit width was relatively wide. When multiple slits or ridges are placed at regular intervals, it is called a diffraction grating and forms an interference pattern due to the repeated constructive and destructive interference of waves. The same was shown for electrons in the electron diffraction experiment carried out during carried out by George Thomson (Son of JJ Thomson) in 1927. This was difficult to show as the electron's wavelength is very small. If we accelerate the electron across a potential difference, we know that \\[ K=\\frac{p^2}{2m}=q_eV \\] If we apply the wavelength equation from earlier, we see that \\[ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 m V q_e}}\\\\ \\lambda = \\frac{1.228}{\\sqrt{V}} nm \\] For an accurate result, the electrons would have to be accelerated at high velocities, which is why the voltages used were in kilovolts. Hence, the wavelength of the electron would have a magnitude of \\(100 \\, pm\\) . For context, the width of a helium atom is \\(62 \\, pm\\) . Hence, to account for this problem, Thomson used a thin piece of graphene which has a hexagonal structure as his grating. The graphene ring has a side length of \\(0.142\\,nm\\) making it a perfect diffraction grating for this problem. In the simplified diagram above, electrons are beamed through a thin graphene sheet. it was shown that the electrons formed an interference pattern similar to that of diffraction with a circular aperture which was consistent with Bragg's law. This showed that electrons exhibited wave-like properties in that they constructively and destructively interfered like waves. Davisson-Germer Experiment The Davisson-Germer Experiment showed a similar result with a slightly different setup. Electrons were beamed at a Nickel target at various angles and the intensity was measured with a movable detecto In this case, the electrons are reflected off of Nickel. They found that the intensity of the light measured peaked at certain angles which were once again consistent with Bragg's law. This is because Nickel has a lattice-like structure formed by its atoms and the lattice spacing is small enough to cause diffraction. Conclusion By 1927, wave-particle duality was shown for both matter and light. Around that same time, Heisenberg was developing his matrix mechanics for quantum mechanics. He was developing this system because at that point the motion of an electron was more spread out in a strange way as compared to being completely deterministic. However, through his calculations, Heisenberg found something shocking about the nature of matter and light.","title":"Wave-particle duality"},{"location":"theory/wpd/#wave-particle-duality","text":"","title":"Wave-particle duality"},{"location":"theory/wpd/#the-wave-theory-and-blackbody-radiation","text":"Before the 20th century, there were numerous theories about the nature of light.

If we accelerate the electron across a potential difference, we know that \\[ K=\\frac{p^2}{2m}=q_eV \\] If we apply the wavelength equation from earlier, we see that \\[ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 m V q_e}}\\\\ \\lambda = \\frac{1.228}{\\sqrt{V}} nm \\] For an accurate result, the electrons would have to be accelerated at high velocities, which is why the voltages used were in kilovolts. Hence, the wavelength of the electron would have a magnitude of \\(100 \\, pm\\) . For context, the width of a helium atom is \\(62 \\, pm\\) . Hence, to account for this problem, Thomson used a thin piece of graphene which has a hexagonal structure as his grating. The graphene ring has a side length of \\(0.142\\,nm\\) making it a perfect diffraction grating for this problem. In the simplified diagram above, electrons are beamed through a thin graphene sheet. it was shown that the electrons formed an interference pattern similar to that of diffraction with a circular aperture which was consistent with Bragg's law. This showed that electrons exhibited wave-like properties in that they constructively and destructively interfered like waves.","title":"Electron Diffraction"},{"location":"theory/wpd/#davisson-germer-experiment","text":"The Davisson-Germer Experiment showed a similar result with a slightly different setup. Electrons were beamed at a Nickel target at various angles and the intensity was measured with a movable detecto In this case, the electrons are reflected off of Nickel. They found that the intensity of the light measured peaked at certain angles which were once again consistent with Bragg's law. This is because Nickel has a lattice-like structure formed by its atoms and the lattice spacing is small enough to cause diffraction.","title":"Davisson-Germer Experiment"},{"location":"theory/wpd/#conclusion","text":"By 1927, wave-particle duality was shown for both matter and light. Around that same time, Heisenberg was developing his matrix mechanics for quantum mechanics. He was developing this system because at that point the motion of an electron was more spread out in a strange way as compared to being completely deterministic. However, through his calculations, Heisenberg found something shocking about the nature of matter and light.","title":"Conclusion"}]}
